## Flow2Spatial reconstructs spatial proteomics through transfer learning 

Flow2Spatial is the computational part of POTTLE (parallel flow projection and transfer learning-based spatial proteomics framework). 

It aims to reconstruct spatial proteomics from the values of parallel-flow projections in POTTLE. Leveraging transfer learning, Flow2Spatial can restore fine structure of protein spatial distribution in different tissue types.
